The New York Times compiled the data from the five boroughs into just the 1 city, which does not have a recognized FIPs code. If I have time, I might go back and average the info from the other data sets and merge it with the city-wide data, but I'm not sure if it's within the scope of this project for me. New York City would be a significant outlier if I added it to the dataset, for better or worse."
